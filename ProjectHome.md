Redef is a mod for Half-Life 2 that redefines First-Person Shooter gameplay. Our philosophy stresses intuitivity but at the same time rejects oversimplification, and in doing so we feel that immersion improved. We aim to develop an engine that allows us to create situations mimicking that of real life closely. Artificial limitations on the player are to be avoided whenever possible. In a word, realism.
